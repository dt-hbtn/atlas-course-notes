# CS1100 Week 3

The following files include examples based on the code from class (1 file per concept):
- `arrays.c`
- `pointers.c`
- `strings.c`
- `switch.c`

Each file has a comment at the top that reminds you how to compile and run the example code. (We did not make it to `switch` statements in class, but the `switch.c` file has a pretty clear usage example.)

Good luck!
